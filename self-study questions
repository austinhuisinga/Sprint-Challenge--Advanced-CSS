   1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

      An adaptive website can be deployed quicker, because it relies on some fixed units. A fully responsive site looks better great at every angle, because it only uses responsive units.

   2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
   
      In a mobile- first web-site, the site is developed as at a mobile size first, then stretched out all the way to a desktop. Min-width media queries are used instead of max-width, like a traditional site uses.

   3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

      It makes calculating the rem conversion value to pixels simpler, by making it 1rem = 10px. 

   4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

      Preprocessing makes CSS more powerful, faster to use, and less repetitive primarily by enabling developers to store values in abstract objects, as well as cleaning things up by nesting. 

   5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

      I think in the future I'll appreciate variables and mixins when I get into more complex, repetitive projects, but based on what we've done so far, nesting has cleaned up my code substantially.
